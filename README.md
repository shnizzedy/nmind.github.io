There are two content streams for this website a Jekyll site (using the [Minimal Mistakes theme](minimal-mistakes)) and a [Jupyter book](site), published at https://nmind.org and https://nmind.org/book, respectively. When changes are made in the [`main` branch](https://github.com/nmind/nmind.github.io/tree/main); GitHub builds both the Jekyll and Jupyter sites and deploys them in the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/nmind/nmind.github.io/tree/main).
