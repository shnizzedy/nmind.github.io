  NMIND (this Neuroimaging Method Is Not Duplicated) is a collaborative 
  dedicated to accelerating scientific discovery in neuroimaging 
  research that was formed in 2020 as a grassroots initiative- responding to 
  the growing frustration about redundancies in effort, continuing questions 
  about the reproducibility of code by independent teams, and challenges 
  arising in the sharing of code between teams due to lack of consistent 
  nomenclature and conventions.
